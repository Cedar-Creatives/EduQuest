# EduQuest Debug Log

This log details the debugging process and the steps taken to resolve server instability issues.

## Initial Investigation:

-   **Symptom**: The server was crashing intermittently without clear error messages.
-   **Initial Analysis**: A review of the codebase revealed inconsistent error handling, excessive logging, and a lack of a graceful shutdown mechanism.

## Debugging Steps:

1.  **`server.js`**: Refactored the main server file to include a global error handler, standardized logging, and a graceful shutdown mechanism.
2.  **`authRoutes.js`**: Refactored the authentication routes to use the `asyncHandler` utility and provide more consistent error responses.
3.  **`profileRoutes.js`**: Refactored the profile routes to simplify the code, extract complex logic into helper functions, and improve readability.
4.  **`quizRoutes.js`**: Refactored the quiz routes to improve error handling and logging, and to ensure that all asynchronous operations are properly handled.
5.  **`dashboardRoutes.js`**: Refactored the dashboard routes to extract complex logic into helper functions and improve the overall structure of the code.

## Final Verification:

-   **Code Review**: Performed a final code review to ensure that all changes were correctly implemented and that no new issues were introduced.
-   **Testing**: Manually tested the application to verify that the server is stable and that all features are working as expected.
