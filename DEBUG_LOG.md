# Debug Log

## Session Start: 2024-07-25

### Initial Analysis

*   **Objective:** Stabilize the crashing EduQuest server.
*   **Initial Observation:** The server is unstable and crashing frequently.

### Investigation & Fixes

1.  **Duplicate Route in `server.js`**
    *   **Issue:** The `dashboardRoutes` and `progressRoutes` were both mounted to `/api/dashboard`, making the progress routes unreachable.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `server/server.js` to mount `progressRoutes` to `/api/progress`.
    *   **Status:** Resolved.

2.  **Incorrect Average Score Calculation in `quizRoutes.js`**
    *   **Issue:** The `/api/quiz/submit` endpoint was attempting to calculate the new average score using `userRef.data`, which is not a valid property of a Firestore document reference. This would cause a `TypeError` and crash the request handler.
    *   **Fix:** Implemented a Firestore transaction to atomically read user data, calculate the new average score, and update the user document. This ensures data consistency and prevents race conditions.
    *   **Status:** Resolved.

3.  **Potential `JSON.parse()` Failure in `openRouterService.js`**
    *   **Issue:** The `generateQuizQuestions` function relies on `JSON.parse()` to process the response from the OpenRouter API. If the API returns a malformed or non-JSON response, this could throw an unhandled exception.
    *   **Fix:** While the existing code has a `try-catch` block, I've noted this as a potential point of failure. No code changes were made at this time, but this is an area to monitor closely.
    *   **Status:** Monitored.

### Next Steps

*   Create `STABILITY_REPORT.md` to summarize the findings.
*   Update `PROGRESS_LOG.md` to reflect the work done in this debugging session.
*   Perform a final startup check to ensure the server is stable.
