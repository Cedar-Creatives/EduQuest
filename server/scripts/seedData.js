    content: `Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with continuous change. It has two major branches:

1. **Differential Calculus**: Studies rates of change and slopes of curves
2. **Integral Calculus**: Studies accumulation of quantities and areas under curves

Key Concepts:
- Limits: The foundation of calculus
- Derivatives: Rate of change
- Integrals: Accumulation of change

Applications:
- Physics (motion, forces)
- Engineering (optimization)
- Economics (marginal analysis)
- Biology (population growth)`,

**Core Concepts:**
- Variables and data types
- Functions and scope
- Objects and arrays
- Event handling

**Modern Features:**
- ES6+ syntax (arrow functions, destructuring)
- Async/await for promises
- Modules and imports
- Template literals

**Best Practices:**
- Use const and let instead of var
- Write readable, self-documenting code
- Handle errors gracefully
- Test your code thoroughly

**Example:**
\`\`\`javascript
const greet = (name) => \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
console.log(greet('World')); // Hello, World!
