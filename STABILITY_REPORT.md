# EduQuest Stability Report

This report outlines the root causes of server instability, the solutions implemented, and recommendations for future monitoring.

## Root Causes of Instability:

1.  **Inadequate Error Handling**: Missing or inconsistent `try-catch` blocks and a lack of centralized error handling led to unhandled exceptions and server crashes.
2.  **Verbose and Inconsistent Logging**: Excessive `console.log` statements without standardized formatting made it difficult to trace requests and identify the root cause of errors.
3.  **Lack of Graceful Shutdown**: The server did not have a proper graceful shutdown mechanism, leading to abrupt terminations and potential data corruption.
4.  **Complex and Untested Code**: Several route files contained complex, untested logic within the route handlers themselves, increasing the risk of unhandled errors.
5.  **Missing Input Validation**: Insufficient input validation in multiple routes made the application vulnerable to malformed requests.

## Solutions Implemented:

1.  **Centralized Error Handling**: A global error handler was added to `server.js` to catch all unhandled exceptions and provide a consistent error response.
2.  **Standardized Logging**: Logging was standardized across all route files to include essential information like the request method, URL, and user ID.
3.  **Graceful Shutdown**: A graceful shutdown mechanism was implemented in `server.js` to ensure that the server closes all connections and cleans up resources before exiting.
4.  **Code Refactoring**: All route files (`authRoutes.js`, `profileRoutes.js`, `quizRoutes.js`, and `dashboardRoutes.js`) were refactored to simplify the code, extract complex logic into helper functions, and improve readability.
5.  **Asynchronous Error Handling**: An `asyncHandler` utility was introduced to ensure that all asynchronous errors are properly caught and passed to the global error handler.

## Monitoring and Alerting:

-   **Proactive Log Monitoring**: Regularly review the server logs for error patterns and unusual activity.
-   **Health Checks**: Utilize the `/api/health` endpoint to monitor the server's status and dependencies.
-   **Performance Monitoring**: Implement a performance monitoring solution to track response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
