# Stability Report

## Root Causes of Crashes

Based on the debugging session, the following root causes of server instability were identified:

1.  **Routing Conflict:** A duplicate route in `server.js` made a set of endpoints unreachable, leading to unexpected behavior and likely 404 errors.
2.  **Type Error in Quiz Submission:** A critical type error in the `/api/quiz/submit` endpoint was causing the request handler to crash when calculating the user's average score. This was a direct cause of server instability.

## Solutions Implemented

*   **Route Correction:** The duplicate route was corrected in `server/server.js`, and the `progressRoutes` are now correctly mounted to `/api/progress`.
*   **Transactional Update:** The quiz submission logic was refactored to use a Firestore transaction, ensuring the safe and atomic update of user statistics. This resolves the `TypeError` and prevents data corruption.

## Performance Improvements

While the primary focus was on stability, the implemented fixes will indirectly improve performance by preventing crashes and ensuring the smooth operation of the quiz submission process.

## Remaining Technical Debt

*   **Misleading `/login` Endpoint:** The `/api/auth/login` endpoint is misnamed, as it doesn't perform password verification. It should be renamed or refactored to avoid confusion.
*   **Insecure Test Endpoint:** The `/api/auth/create-test-user` endpoint should be disabled in production environments to prevent unauthorized user creation.
*   **OpenRouter API Dependency:** The application's stability is still dependent on the reliability of the OpenRouter API. Further resilience could be built in by implementing features like retries with exponential backoff and caching.

## Recommendations for Monitoring

*   **Log Analysis:** Continuously monitor the server logs for any new or recurring errors, especially those related to the OpenRouter API.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Implement a tool to monitor key performance metrics like API response times, memory usage, and CPU load. This will help to proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks.
*   **Uptime Monitoring:** Set up an external service to monitor the server's uptime and provide alerts in case of a crash.
