## Final Notes
Focus on creating a delightful, fast, and engaging experience that makes Nigerian students excited about exam preparation. Prioritize functionality over complex features - better to have fewer features that work perfectly than many features that work poorly.

The goal is an MVP that students will want to use daily and recommend to their friends, setting the foundation for future expansion to university level and additional subjects.
