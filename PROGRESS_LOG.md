## [2025-01-01 20:00] - Final Fixes and Debugging

**Status:** üöÄ In Progress

**Files Modified:**

- client/src/pages/Onboarding.tsx
- client/src/App.tsx
- client/src/pages/NotFoundPage.tsx
- PROGRESS_LOG.md

**Changes Made:**

- Created a `NotFoundPage` component to handle invalid URLs.
- Updated the `App.tsx` file to include a catch-all route for the `NotFoundPage`.
- Replaced the direct `fetch` call in `Onboarding.tsx` with the `completeOnboardingProfile` function from the API layer.
- Removed the `useAuth` hook from `Onboarding.tsx` as it is no longer needed.

**Issues & Solutions:**

- **Issue:** The application was not handling invalid URLs, leading to a poor user experience.
- **Solution:** Created a `NotFoundPage` component and added a catch-all route to `App.tsx`.
- **Issue:** The `Onboarding.tsx` component was using a direct `fetch` call, which is inconsistent with the rest of the application.
- **Solution:** Replaced the `fetch` call with the `completeOnboardingProfile` function from the API layer.

**Next Steps:**

- Verify all other `pages` files for any other "rogue" `fetch` calls.
- Start the application and try to reproduce the "Service Unavailable" error.
- If the error persists, check the backend server logs to identify the root cause.

**Handover Notes:**

- The application now handles invalid URLs gracefully.
- The `Onboarding.tsx` component is now consistent with the rest of the application's API layer.
